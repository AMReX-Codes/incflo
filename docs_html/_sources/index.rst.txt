Welcome to incflo's documentation!
====================================

incflo is an AMReX-basd simulation code for modeling
the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.  It includes 
adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) but without subcycling in time.
(If you want subcyling, please see

https://github.com/amrex-codes/IAMR.

incflo is under active development as part of DOE's Exascale Computing Project. 

Active development in incflo is ongoing in the development branch. 
Changes are merged into the master branch at the beginning of each month.
